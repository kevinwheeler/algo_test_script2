README

Credit to Renato Recio for originally making this script during one of the intial assignments. I edited it to make it work for assignment 5.

IMPORTANT: this script assumes that there is exactly one stable price vector for each MWMCM in that it checks that the price vector you output is exactly the same as the sample output. If it turns out there is more than one stable price vector you could have outputted, then it may say you failed when you didn't.
